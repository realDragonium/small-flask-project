### Okay so I wanna create a small quiz websites: 
- So you need to be able to create quizzes which contain questions which each have multiple answers and one of them is the right one. 
- So quizzes need to be made
- The quizzes need to be able to retrieve without the right answer
- Do I want them to be created in a single go or can they also be updated? 
- You also need to be able to check your answers, at the end?
- We should also log it when someone finished a quiz
- So we also kinda need accounts



## Quiz

- Create
- Update
